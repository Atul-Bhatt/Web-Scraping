Run Scrawler using its name (variable in Spider class)
    scrapy crawl <crawler_name>

If you don't want to implement the start_requests() method of Spider then use the start_urls attribute
of spider method and initialize it with a list of urls. It will use the default start_requests() method.

Even if we don't call parse method it is called because Scrapy's default callback method is parse.

scrapy shell "http://quotes.toscrape.com/page/1/"
